# 🍕 PIZZA-LICIOUS POS — Pizza-Lab

A fully interactive Point of Sale (POS) system for a custom pizza shop. Built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming, this console application lets users create fully customized pizzas, add drinks and garlic knots, review orders, and automatically generate timestamped receipt files.

# 📌 Project Overview

Pizza-Lab is a menu-driven POS application designed for PIZZA-licious, a growing pizza shop transitioning from handwritten orders to a fully automated ordering system. Customers can build pizzas from scratch, select sauces, cheeses, toppings, and meats, choose crust type, add drinks and sides, and complete checkout.

The application includes a clean UI, color-coded console output, object-oriented structure, and automatic receipt generation.
